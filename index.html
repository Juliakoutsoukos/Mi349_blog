      <h2>My Experience at Michigan State</h2>

        Being a student at Michigan State University has been an amazing experience. From the exciting football games to the peaceful walks through campus, every day brings something new. As an Information Science major, I've had the opportunity to explore both technology and people, which fits my Human-Centered Design track perfectly. The professors are helpful, and my classmates are creative and passionate.

      <p>
        One of the highlights of my week is attending field hockey club meetings and working on design projects for class. The workload can be intense, but the sense of progress and community makes it worth it. Iâ€™ve also grown my technical skills by building projects like this blog and learning how to use GitHub, Codespaces, and Netlify.

      <h2>My Favorite Travel Destinations</h2>

        Traveling is one of my favorite hobbies. I love exploring new places, trying local food, and taking scenic photos. Some of my favorite destinations include Italy for its architecture, Budapest for its energy, and Greece for its scenic natural beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each trip gives me a new perspective and helps me better understand different communities and cultures. I always carry a journal to document memories, and I love creating photo albums of each trip when I get back home.
